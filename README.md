# Interpreter
c++ customizable interpreter

What this is:
My attempt to create a program that runs code written on a .txt file

How to use: \n
change the file path in Interpreter.cpp and then build and run the file \n
At the top of the .txt file you want to run, you should have a file path to the keywords that you want to use
If you want to edit keywords, copy default.txt and replace the words with those of your choice.
